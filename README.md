# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python

A repository containing exercises, implementations, and notes from the **Udemy course – Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises**.  

## 📚 About  
This repo serves as a personal learning playground for practicing **DSA fundamentals** using Python. It includes worked-out exercises, implementations of common algorithms, and hands-on coding challenges to build problem-solving skills.  

## 🛠️ Contents  
- **Arrays & Strings** – basic operations, searching, sorting.  
- **Linked Lists** – singly and doubly linked list implementations.  
- **Stacks & Queues** – using lists and `collections.deque`.  
- **Recursion** – solving problems with recursive techniques.  
- **Sorting & Searching** – bubble sort, merge sort, binary search, etc.  
- **Trees & Graphs** – binary trees, traversal algorithms, graph representations.  
- **Practice Problems** – assorted exercises from the course.  

## ✅ Goals
- Strengthen understanding of core data structures.
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch.
- Develop problem-solving skills for coding interviews and real-world scenarios.
